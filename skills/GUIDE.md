## When to Use One Pattern vs. Compose Multiple

**Use a single pattern directly** for most tasks. The overhead of composing multiple
patterns is only justified when outputs from one pattern are required inputs for another.

**Compose patterns when:**

- Planning → Implementation → Tests (outputs chain: plan feeds implementation, implementation feeds tests)
- Research → Design → Implementation (research informs a design decision that informs code)
- A task has 3+ truly distinct steps that can't be collapsed

**Do not compose when:**

- You're just doing one thing (implement a feature, write a test)
- Two patterns are independent (research and test-writing for separate features)
- Adding `coordinating-work` would be more ceremony than the task itself

---

## Pattern Pairs (Common Compositions)

### Design → Implement

```
designing-systems   →   implementing-features
```

Use when you need to decide _how_ to build something before building it.
The ADR produced by `designing-systems` is the spec for `implementing-features`.

### Implement → Test

```
implementing-features   →   writing-tests
```

The most common composition. Use after every non-trivial implementation.

### Plan → Implement → Test

```
planning-tasks   →   implementing-features   →   writing-tests
```

For features with 3+ steps. The plan breaks it down; each task gets its own
`implementing-features` + `writing-tests` cycle.

### Research → Design

```
researching-options   →   designing-systems
```

Use when a design decision requires technical evidence before the decision can be made.
Research produces a recommendation; `designing-systems` turns it into a documented ADR.

### Full Stack (complex feature)

```
planning-tasks
  → researching-options   (for unknowns flagged in plan)
  → designing-systems     (for architecture decisions)
  → implementing-features (per task in plan)
  → writing-tests         (per implementation)
```
