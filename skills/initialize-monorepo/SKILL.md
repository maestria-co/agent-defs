  Bootstrap .context/ for a monorepo with multiple packages or services. Use when
  setting up the agent system for a monorepo — triggered by "initialize this monorepo",
  "set up context for our monorepo", "we have a packages/ directory and need context
  docs", "our Nx/Turborepo/Lerna workspace needs bootstrapping", or any time a
  multi-package repo has no .context/ and needs to be onboarded. Creates both a
  root-level overview and per-package context directories.

# Skill: Initialize Monorepo

## Purpose

Bootstrap `.context/` for a monorepo by creating both a root-level overview and per-package 
context directories. This skill extends `initialize-repo` to handle repositories with multiple 
packages or services that need coordinated but separate documentation. Prevents the common 
mistake of merging all package context into a single jumbled document.

---

## Pre-Flight Checks

Run these checks from the `initialize-repo` skill first:

- [ ] Check for existing `.context/` directory (warn if exists, don't overwrite)
- [ ] Locate context_template directory (`~/.copilot/skills/_shared/context_template/` or `~/.claude/skills/_shared/context_template/`)
- [ ] Verify git repository root
- [ ] Confirm write permissions

**Stop if any check fails** — resolve issues before proceeding.

## Phase 1: Detect Monorepo Structure

### Detection Strategies by Tool

| Build Tool | Detection Method | Output |
|------------|------------------|--------|
| npm/yarn/pnpm workspaces | Read `workspaces` field in root `package.json` | List of glob patterns |
| Nx | Read `nx.json` and `project.json` files | List of project paths |
| Turborepo | Read `turbo.json` and workspace config | List of package paths |
| Lerna | Read `lerna.json` packages field | List of glob patterns |
| Maven | Read parent `pom.xml` modules | List of module directories |
| Gradle | Read `settings.gradle` include statements | List of project paths |

### Steps

1. **Identify the monorepo tool** — Check for config files in the repository root
2. **List all packages/services** — Extract package locations from the config
3. **Resolve globs** — If using patterns like `packages/*`, expand to actual directories
4. **Read package metadata** — For each package, extract:
   - Package name
   - Package purpose (from README, package.json description, or pom.xml)
   - Entry points (main files, public APIs)

### Output

```markdown
## Detected Monorepo Structure

Tool: [npm workspaces / Nx / Maven / etc.]
Packages found: [N]

| Package Path | Name | Purpose |
|--------------|------|---------|
| packages/ui-lib | @acme/ui | Shared UI components |
| packages/api | @acme/api | REST API service |
| apps/web | @acme/web | Main web application |
```

---

## Phase 2: Build Dependency Graph

### Goal

Understand which packages depend on which others to document relationships and build order.

### Detection Methods

| Language | Method | Command |
|----------|--------|---------|
| JavaScript/TypeScript | Read `dependencies` in package.json | `npm list --all --json` or parse files |
| Java (Maven) | Read `<dependencies>` in pom.xml | `mvn dependency:tree` |
| Java (Gradle) | Read `dependencies` block | `gradle dependencies` |
| Python | Read `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` | Parse dependencies |

### Steps

1. **Extract dependencies for each package** — Read from package manifests
2. **Filter for internal dependencies** — Keep only dependencies on other packages in this repo
3. **Build directed graph** — Create edges from consumer → dependency
4. **Calculate build order** — Topologically sort the graph

### Output

```markdown
## Package Dependencies

### Dependency Graph
[package-a] → [shared-lib]
[package-b] → [shared-lib]
[app] → [package-a], [package-b]

### Build Order
1. [shared-lib]
2. [package-a], [package-b] (parallel)
3. [app]
```

---

## Phase 3: Create Root-Level Context

### Root `.context/overview.md`

Template:

```markdown
# [Monorepo Name] Overview

## Repository Type
Monorepo containing [N] packages/services

## Build Tool
[npm workspaces / Nx / Maven / etc.]

## Package Directory
| Package | Purpose | Consumers |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| [name] | [what it does] | [who uses it] |

## Tech Stack
- [Language/framework for each type of package]
- [Build tool]
- [Testing frameworks]
- [CI/CD platform]

## Getting Started
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone [repo-url]
cd [repo-name]
[install command]

# Build all packages
[build command]

# Run tests
[test command]
```

## Cross-Package Development
- How to link packages locally
- How to test changes across multiple packages
- How to version and release
```

### Root `.context/architecture.md` (Monorepo section)

Add a "Package Structure" section to the root `architecture.md` documenting the dependency relationships discovered in Phase 2, with a diagram if helpful.

### Root `.context/workflows/monorepo-workflow.md`

```markdown
# Monorepo Workflow

## Building
- **Individual package**: [command to build one package]
- **All packages**: [command to build all]
- **Changed packages only**: [command if supported]

## Testing
- **Individual package**: [command]
- **All packages**: [command]
- **Affected tests only**: [command if supported]

## Releasing
- [Versioning strategy — independent vs. fixed]
- [Release process — manual vs. automated]
- [Changelog generation]

## Common Tasks
- Adding a new package: [steps]
- Moving code between packages: [steps]
- Deprecating a package: [steps]
```

---

## Phase 4: Create Per-Package Context

For each package/service:

### Package `.context/overview.md`

Template:

```markdown
# [Package Name]

## Purpose
[What this package does, why it exists]

## Public Interface
- Entry point: [main file or module]
- Exports: [key functions/classes/components]
- API surface: [list or link to API docs]

## Consumers
- [Other packages that depend on this one]
- [External systems if a service]

## Development
```bash
# Run package tests
[command]

# Run package locally (if a service)
[command]

# Build package
[command]
```

## Dependencies
- Internal: [other packages in this repo]
- External: [key external dependencies]

## Special Considerations
[Any package-specific quirks, performance notes, security considerations]
```

### Package `.context/domains/` (optional)

Create domain documents only if this package has significant domain knowledge not shared 
across the monorepo. If domain knowledge applies to multiple packages, put it in the root 
`.context/domains/` instead.

### Skip Generated Packages

Do not create context documentation for:
- Packages containing only generated code
- Build artifacts directories
- Node_modules or vendor directories

---

## Phase 5: Configure AI Tools

### Root `CLAUDE.md` or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

Template addition:

```markdown
## Monorepo Structure

This is a monorepo containing [N] packages. Context documentation is organized as:

- **Root context** (`.context/` at repo root): Monorepo-wide architecture, workflows, decisions
- **Package context** (`packages/[name]/.context/`): Package-specific details — uses the same flat-file structure (`overview.md`, `standards.md`, `testing.md`, `architecture.md`)

When working on a specific package, consult both the root context and the package-specific context.

### Package Index
[List packages with one-line descriptions]

### Build Commands
- Build all: `[command]`
- Test all: `[command]`
- Build single package: `[command]`
```

### Per-Package Instructions (Optional)

Package-level `CLAUDE.md` files are optional — root instructions are the primary entry point. 
Only add per-package instructions if the package has unique conventions that override root conventions.

---

## Phase 6: Verification

### Checklist

- [ ] Root `.context/overview.md` exists and lists all packages
- [ ] Root `.context/architecture.md` has a "Package Structure" section documenting package relationships
- [ ] Root `.context/workflows/monorepo-workflow.md` explains build/test/release
- [ ] Each non-generated package has `.context/overview.md`
- [ ] Root `CLAUDE.md` or `.github/copilot-instructions.md` points to context directories
- [ ] All required files from `initialize-repo` checklist exist at root
- [ ] No context files created for generated-only packages
- [ ] Dependency graph matches actual package.json/pom.xml/build.gradle

### Verification Commands

```bash
# List all context directories created
find . -name ".context" -type d

# Verify context files exist
ls -la .context/
ls -la packages/*/.context/ 2>/dev/null
```

---

## Output Format

```markdown
## Monorepo Initialization Complete

### Root Context
- `.context/overview.md` — [N] packages documented
- `.context/architecture.md` — package relationships and dependency graph documented
- `.context/workflows/monorepo-workflow.md` — build/test/release documented

### Package Context
- `packages/[name]/.context/overview.md` — [repeated for each package]

### AI Tool Configuration
- `CLAUDE.md` — configured with monorepo structure

### Build Order
[shared-lib] → [package-a] → [app]

### Next Steps
1. Review generated context for accuracy
2. Fill in any [TODO] placeholders
3. Add domain-specific documentation to `.context/domains/` as needed (optional — only for complex domains)
4. Commit context documentation to version control
```

---

## Constraints

- **Never merge multiple packages' domain knowledge into a single .context/ file** — keep them 
  separate. Root overview describes relationships; package overviews describe the package itself.
- **Do not generate context for packages containing only generated code** — these add noise.
- **Root context is the source of truth for relationships** — package context describes only 
  that package, not its relationships.
- **Follow all constraints from initialize-repo skill** — this skill extends it.
- **Do not create circular references** — if package A depends on package B, B cannot depend on A.
- **Verify all build commands actually work** — don't document commands that fail.
