# Agent Definitions

This directory contains reusable, platform-agnostic AI agent definitions for software development teams. Each agent is a markdown file with a detailed system prompt, designed to be loaded into any AI assistant (GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.).

## What Are Agents?

An agent is an AI assistant operating under a specific role with clear responsibilities, constraints, and behaviors. Rather than using a single general-purpose AI for everything, agents give the AI a focused identity and set of rules — making outputs more consistent, predictable, and high-quality.

Think of agents like specialized team members:

- You wouldn't ask your QA engineer to design your database schema.
- You wouldn't ask your architect to write unit tests.
- Same principle applies here.

## Agent Roster

### Core Agents

| Agent          | File                  | One-Sentence Role                                                       |

## Workflow Overview

All user requests flow through the **Manager**. The Manager decides which specialists to invoke and in what order. For multi-project work, **Workspace-Manager** or **Monorepo-Manager** serves as the entry point and delegates to Manager instances per project.

```

**Typical flow for a new feature:**

1. User describes the goal to **Manager**
2. **Manager** asks **Product-Manager** to structure requirements (if vague)
3. **Manager** asks **Planner** to break it down
4. **Planner** identifies unknowns → **Researcher** fills gaps
5. **Manager** asks **Architect** to review design decisions
6. **Manager** asks **Coder** to implement
7. **Coder** signals done → **Tester** validates
8. **Reviewer** checks code quality
9. **Manager** reports outcome to user

## How to Use These Agents

### Option A: Direct invocation (Copilot / Claude chat)

Paste the contents of an agent file at the start of your conversation as a system prompt, then proceed with your request.

```
[paste contents of agents/manager.md]

Hi, I need to add user authentication to my Express app.
```

### Option B: Reference in your project's copilot-instructions.md

Add a reference to these agents so Copilot knows they exist:

```markdown
# Agent Roles

This project uses a multi-agent system. See agents/ for role definitions.
When handling complex tasks, follow the workflow defined in agents/README.md.
```

### Option C: Invoke by role name

In a Copilot or Claude conversation, reference an agent by role:

```
Act as the Planner agent (see agents/planner.md) and break down this task: ...
```

## Shared Resources

All agents follow the rules in `_shared/`:

| File                          | Purpose                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `_shared/conventions.md`      | Tone, format, tool-use rules shared by all agents |
| `_shared/handoff-protocol.md` | How agents hand work off to each other            |

---

## Context & Memory

Agents use the `.context/` directory to persist knowledge across sessions:

| Path                           | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `.context/project-overview.md` | High-level project description, goals, tech stack    |
| `.context/decisions/`          | Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)                 |
| `.context/retrospectives/`     | Rolling learning log — agents append, humans promote |

**Before starting work**, agents should read `.context/project-overview.md` if it exists.  
**After significant decisions**, agents should write to `.context/decisions/`.  
**After completing tasks**, agents should append to the current retrospective log.

---

## Adding New Agents

When a new specialized role is needed:

1. Copy the structure from an existing agent file
2. Fill in all sections: Purpose, Triggers, Inputs, Outputs, Responsibilities, Handoffs, Constraints, Anti-patterns, Example
3. Add the agent to the roster table in this README
4. Update the workflow diagram if the agent changes the flow
5. Add a shared conventions reference in the agent's preamble

---

## Versioning

These agent definitions are version-controlled alongside your code. When you make significant changes to an agent's behavior:

- Update the agent file
- Note the change reason in the file's changelog section (bottom of each agent file)
- Append a retrospective entry explaining what changed and why
